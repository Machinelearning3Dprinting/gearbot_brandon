# A Few Things You Should Know

#### **In Folder [_**STL Files**_](https://github.com/Machinelearning3Dprinting/gearbot_brandon/tree/main/3D%20Print%20Stuff/STL%20Files) You will find all the STL files to have a modular case of your own for your Arduino Prortenta H7 with Vision Sheild**

---

#### **In Folder [_**Ultimaker Cura Profiles**_](https://github.com/Machinelearning3Dprinting/gearbot_brandon/tree/main/3D%20Print%20Stuff/Ultimaker%20Cura%20Profiles) You will find the print settings Files that you can then import in to Ultimaker Cura to Make printing easy for you**

All the STL Files Were Made Using **AUTODESK FUSION 360**

I Printed Them Using My ANYCUBIC i3 MEGA and My ANYCUBIC MEGA X

  * ANYCUBIC i3 MEGA Build Space \--- 210 x 210 x 205mm

  * ANYCUBIC MEGA X Build Space \--- 300 x 300 x 305mm

A Couple Of Things Needed To Make The Case Work
  * M2*16 Bolts 
  
  * M3\*6 Bolts -- Really M3\*3 For The Screen Case
   
  * 2\*6mm Rare Earth Magnets or Fridge Mangets Work

> **Note:** You Can Not Just Print The STL Files As Is They Are To Exact Dimensions \--- You Need To Change A Few Setting In Your Slicing Software Or Edit The STL Files Either In FUSION 360 Or A Program Of Your Chose 
> 
> FUSION 360 Would Be The Easiest To Make The Appropriate Edits As I Have Inculded The \".f3d" Files
