# Printing The STL's

If You Use Ultimaker Cura Slicing Software --- Follow The Steps Below To Have A Successful Print

1. Dowlaod The Profile Files In [Ultimaker Cura Profiles](https://github.com/Machinelearning3Dprinting/gearbot_brandon/tree/main/3D%20Print%20Stuff) This Will Make Your Life A Thousand Times Eaiser 
2. Find The Setting Called \"Horizontal Expantion" Now Change That To Whatever Your Machine Tolorance is Making Sure it's A Negitave Number Or It Won't Work
    * If You Don't Change The \"Horizontal Expantion" Setting You Can See What Tolorancese I Used For Each Print

3. Find The Setting Called \"Initial Layer Horizontal Expantion" It Sould Be Just Below The Setting We Just Changed Now Add \-0.1 to Whatever Number Is There After You Changed The Last Setting
    * Again If You Don't Change The \"Initial Layer Horizontal Expantion" Setting You Can See What Tolorancese I Used For Each Print

4. Once You've Done That Now Take A Look In The Material Drop Down Menu And Make Sure The Print Temps Are Set Right For Your Filament And Machine
5. One Last Step Check The Flow Rate Under The Same Menu To Make Sure It's Set Right As Well
6. Your Done Now Slice And Dice and Your Ready To Print
